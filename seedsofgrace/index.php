    <h1>Dream Big Plant Small</h1>
<p>
Seeds of Grace is building partnerships all over the world, and in our own back yard, to build gardens to help feed the children who are hungry.  From feeding centers in Mazatl√°n to food banks in Bremerton, our teams work hard to pull together the resources that will be components of gardens to be grown to fill the pantries of the recipient organizations so that the healthy options of fresh, sustainably and organically grown fruit and vegetables are on the tables of the hungry.  We have opportunities to learn, give, go, share and join. Contact us and tell us how we can work together to achieve the goals of Seeds of Grace.
